### 📝 Initial Prompt & Problem Selection

You requested an exploration of day-to-day problems with potential tech-based solutions that align with the SDGs. Among the shortlisted issues, we focused on:

> **Problem 6: Youth Unemployment & Skills Mismatch**

#### Challenge:

Many young people, especially in developing regions, lack access to quality skill-building resources and struggle to find job opportunities aligned with their capabilities.

#### Solution:

Build a mobile/web platform that delivers:

* Microlearning (5-min daily lessons)
* AI-powered skill coaching
* Real-time job/gig discovery

### 🔎 Prompt Engineering (Claude)

Prompts were designed for Claude (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to:

* Act as a **personal skill coach**
* Deliver 5-minute personalized lessons
* Recommend learning paths based on interests
* Provide feedback and motivation

Example Prompt:

> "You're an AI career coach. Recommend a 5-minute digital skill lesson for a 19-year-old who likes design and is looking for a remote gig. Include an interactive quiz."

### 🎨 UI/UX Design Using MGX

**Tool:** MGX.dev

* Brief @agent(@Alex) with prompts like:

> "Design a clean, mobile-first UI for a skill microlearning app with a dashboard, daily task reminder, and job board."

* Quickly generate design components and export them to Figma or code.

---

### 💻 Backend Integration Using Supabase

Once the UI is built in MGX/Figma:

1. **Supabase** is used to:

   * Store user profiles, skills progress, job applications
   * Handle authentication (email/OTP login)
   * Serve real-time updates (e.g., lesson completion)
2. **Lovable.dev or Bolt.new** can auto-generate documentation & APIs from schema.

### 🔬 Competitor Analysis

We benchmarked against platforms in 3 categories:

* **Microlearning** (e.g., Duolingo, Skillshare)
* **Job discovery** (e.g., Fuzu, Shortlist)
* **AI-based learning tools** (e.g., Yoma, ReSkill)

> Unique Advantage: Combining Duolingo-style learning + Fuzu job board + ChatGPT coaching in a youth-first app.
